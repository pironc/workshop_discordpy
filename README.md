# Step 0 : Prerequisite

For this workshop, you will need to have a few different packages already installed.

**Note : for most of these commands, the "--user" flag might be optional if you run them as root / higher privileges acces (sudo)**  
**If you have any troubles with the prerequisite, please let us know so we can try to solve it for you to work as soon as possible

**If you are not using Fedora, please install the following libraries / languages using your OS' package manager.**  

```
sudo dnf install python3
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py --user
pip3 install requests --user
pip3 install browser-cookie3 --user
```

To install BeautifulSoup4, it might be a little tidious.

Please try one of the following :

```
sudo python3 -m pip install bs4
pip3 install beautifulsoup4 --user
python3 -m pip install bs4
```

For the next steps, please refer to the ${step_X} folders in the repository.

Each step is designed to get you back on tracks if anything is not working properly, or if you've been having troubles with the previous steps.
Using the files is not the goal of this workshop. If you really are interested, please do not go to the next steps repositories not to spoil yourself with the content you will have to create. This is educational, you will not have a grade or whatever. The only thing we can do is trust you.
