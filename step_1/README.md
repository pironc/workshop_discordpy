# Step 1 : Create your bot

In this first step, you will learn to create a simple useless and offline bot in the discord server.  
What we mean by that is that it will just be a bot you can invite in the server, but will actually not do anything and will not be online.  
In the next steps, we will see the actual code to make it work.

## Step 1.1 : Create your Application

In the discord "developer language", it's not actually a bot but an **Application**.  
You will have to create a new application with a name.

Be creative so your bot will not look like the other ones, and actually easier to figure out which is who's.

Having troubles? uhh.. alright. We'll give you a hint :

## Step 1.2 : Set your Application as a BOT

Discord doesn't actually know your application is made to become a BOT.  
It should be pretty obvious on where to go to do so. If you're having troubles, check the following image

## Step 1.3 : Get an invitation link

Finally, you will need to invite the bot in our server.  
It isn't pretty obvious on how to do, these steps aren't really that important but still useful to know they exist,  
and how to do it if you want to create discord bots in the future.  
You can look it up yourself or check the image down below :

### **In order not to mess everything up, we will not give you the rights to invite the bot to the server as it also gives extra permissions that could be annoying if not properly used. Please, let us know when you finished this step so we will invite your BOT ourselves and set its role accordingly.**
